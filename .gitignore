# If your "Easy-qPCR/" directory (mentioned in your git status) contains
# output files, large data files that shouldn't be versioned, or other
# generated content, you might want to ignore it or specific subdirectories/files within it.
# For example, if it's purely for scripts that ARE part of the app, then DO NOT ignore it.
# If it contains generated outputs, you might do:
# Easy-qPCR/outputs/
# Easy-qPCR/*.csv # If these are generated results, not input data

# If you have other specific files or directories to ignore, add them below.
