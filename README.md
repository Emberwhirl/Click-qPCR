## Overview

Click-qPCR is a user-friendly Shiny web application designed for the straightforward analysis of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) data.

**This tool is readily accessible via a web browser at <https://kubo-azu.shinyapps.io/Click-qPCR/>, requiring no local installation for end-users.**

It allows users to upload their Cq (quantification cycle) values, perform ŒîCq and ŒîŒîCq calculations, visualize results as bar plots with individual data points, and download both the statistical summaries and publication-quality plots.

For users who prefer to run or modify the application locally, the source code is also available (see Installation and Usage section below).

This tool aims to simplify common qPCR data analysis workflows, making them more accessible to researchers without requiring extensive programming knowledge.

-   **Data Preview:** View the first 10 rows of your uploaded data to ensure it's loaded correctly.

-   **Tab-Based Analysis:** The user interface is organized into clear tabs for different analyses.

    -   **Preproceccing and ŒîCq Analysis:**
        -   Select one or **multiple reference genes**. The ŒîCq is calculated using the mean Cq of the selected reference genes.
        -   Select one or more target genes.
        -   Set up **multiple group comparisons** simultaneously using an intuitive interface.
        -   Calculates relative expression ($2^{-\Delta Cq}$).
        -   Performs Welch's t-test for statistical significance for each specified pair.
        -   Visualizes all results in a comprehensive bar plot showing mean ¬± SD, with individual data points overlaid.

    -   **ŒîŒîCq Analysis:**
        -   Automatically uses the reference gene(s) selected in the "Preproceccing and ŒîCq Analysis" tab.
        -   Select a target gene, a base/control group, and one or more treatment groups.
        -   Calculates fold-change ($2^{-\Delta\Delta Cq}$) relative to the base group.
        -   Performs Welch's t-test for statistical significance.
        -   Visualizes results in a dedicated bar plot.

    -   **ANOVA (Dunnett's post-hoc):**
        -   Designed for comparing three or more groups.
        -   Performs a **one-way ANOVA** followed by **Dunnett's post-hoc test** to compare each treatment group against a single control group.
        -   Results are visualized as Relative Expression ($2^{-\Delta Cq}$) on the **"ŒîCq ANOVA (Dunnett's post-hoc)"** tab.
        -   The same statistical results can be visualized as Fold Change ($2^{-\Delta\Delta Cq}$) on the **"ŒîŒîCq ANOVA (Dunnett's post-hoc)"** tab.

-   **Advanced Downloading & Plotting:**
    -   **Custom Plot Dimensions:** Interactively adjust the width, height, and resolution (DPI) for downloaded plots using sliders.
    -   **Fixed Aspect Ratio:** Optionally lock the plot's aspect ratio while resizing.
    -   **Two Download Modes:**
        1.  **Download Plot:** Saves an image using your custom dimension and DPI settings.
        2.  **Save Displayed Size:** Saves an image that is an exact replica of the plot shown on the screen.
    - **Customizable Plot Colors:** Select from several built-in color palettes, including colorblind-friendly and grayscale options, to customize your plot's appearance for presentations or publications.

| Palette Name                  | Key Features & Recommendations                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Default (ggplot2)** | The standard, well-recognized `ggplot2` theme. A safe and familiar choice for initial data exploration.                                          |
| **Balanced (Set2)** | **(Recommended for General Use)** Provides a set of clear, distinct colors that are easy on the eyes and work well on screen.                     |
| **Colorblind-Friendly (Viridis)** | **(Best for Publications & Presentations)** Ensures that your plots are accessible to everyone, including those with color vision deficiencies. |
| **Paired Colors** | Consists of light/dark pairs of colors. Ideal for analyses where you have paired or closely related experimental groups to compare.               |
| **Pastel (Pastel1)** | A selection of softer, less saturated colors. A great choice for posters or when a less intense visual style is preferred.                      |
| **Grayscale (for printing)** | **(Essential for B&W Publications)** Renders the plot in shades of gray. Use this to confirm your figure is interpretable without color.        |


-   **Robust & Informative:**
    -   Handles cases with insufficient data or zero variance gracefully without crashing.
    -   Provides clear messages in the results table (e.g., "Zero variance") when statistics cannot be calculated.

-   **Diagnostics Tab:**
    -   This tab provides a self-testing function. When you click the "Run Diagnostics" button, the app uses its built-in sample data to automatically test four of its core functions:
        1.  Sample Data Loading
        2.  ŒîCq Analysis (t-test) Validation
        3.  ŒîŒîCq Analysis (Fold Change) Validation
        4.  ANOVA and Dunnett's Test Validation
    -   If all tests show "Passed ‚úÖ", you can be confident that the app's calculation and statistical capabilities are functioning as intended.

## Example Analysis with Sample Data

This section demonstrates how to use the app's core functions with the built-in sample data.

### 1. Load Sample Data and Perform ŒîCq Analysis

First, we'll compare the expression of a single gene between two groups using aWelch's t-test.

* On the **"Preprocessing and ŒîCq Analysis"** tab, click the **"Use Example Data"** button.
* Check the box for **"Enable multiple reference genes"**.
* For "Reference Gene(s)", select both `Gapdh` and `Actb`.
* For "Target Gene(s)", ensure only `Hoge` is selected.
* Under "Comparison Settings," set up a comparison between `Control` and `Treatment_X`.
* Click the blue **"Analyze"** button.

#### **Expected Output**

You will see a bar chart and a data table summarizing the analysis. The sample data is designed to show that `Hoge` expression is significantly lower in the `Treatment_X` group compared to the `Control` group.

**Plot:** The chart will display two bars for the `Hoge` gene: one for the `Control` group and one for the `Treatment_X` group. Individual data points will be scattered over the bars, and the bar for `Treatment_X` will be noticeably lower than the `Control` bar. A significance bracket (`***`) will connect the two bars.

**Statistics Table:** The table below the plot will show the result of the Welch's t-test performed on the ŒîCq values. The p-value will be very small, resulting in a high significance level.

| gene | group1  | group2      | p_value  | sig |
| :--- | :------ | :---------- | :------- | :-- |
| Hoge | Control | Treatment_X | 1.25e-05 | *** |

---

### 2. Perform ANOVA with Dunnett's Post-Hoc Test

Next, we'll compare one gene across multiple treatment groups against a single control group. The reference genes selected in the first tab (`Gapdh` and `Actb`) will be automatically used.

* Navigate to the **"ŒîCq ANOVA (Dunnett's post-hoc)"** tab.
* Select `Hoge` as the "Target Gene".
* Select `Control` as the "Control Group".
* Select `Treatment_X`, `Treatment_Y`, and `Treatment_Z` in the "Treatment Group(s)" box.
* Click the blue **"Run ANOVA"** button.

#### **Expected Output**

This analysis performs a one-way ANOVA to see if there are any differences among the four groups, followed by Dunnett's test to specifically compare each treatment group to the control. The sample data will show that all treatment groups are significantly different from the control.

**Plot:** The chart will display four bars for the `Hoge` gene, one for each group (`Control`, `Treatment_X`, `Treatment_Y`, `Treatment_Z`). Significance brackets will be shown comparing each treatment group back to the `Control` bar.

**Statistics Table:** The table will first display the overall result of the ANOVA F-test, which should be highly significant. Below that, it will list the results of Dunnett's test for each treatment-control comparison.

| group1       | group2                               | p_value  | sig |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------- | :------- | :-- |
| ANOVA F-test | F(3, 12) = 59.39                     | 3.12e-08 |     |
| Control      | Treatment_X - Control = 0            | 2.11e-05 | *** |
| Control      | Treatment_Y - Control = 0            | 1.34e-03 | ** |
| Control      | Treatment_Z - Control = 0            | 2.00e-07 | *** |
